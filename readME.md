I'm currently creating a card game block and it was very annoying to create a pdf and sort the cards to make cubes so I decided to create a little app to do one of the steps that some sites ask money for.
The way this is used is you can get a list of cards from another app or an excel get it as a simple txt file.
Then use that file to sort throught the images and compile them into a pdf.
I used it for cards and then to help a photographer to go through wedding pictures.
